# CoolAvatars

* Welcome to this repository of CoolAvatars. Using this project, you can generate cool avatars not only from the samples present in my image dataset but even from your own
images.

* There are 3 ways the same can be done.
  1) Using the main_generator.py file and running it on terminal with proper arguements.
  2) Using the Tkinter based app and run it on any OS.
  3) Using the Web app that can be accessed from anywhere.
  
## The method 1 is currently ready to use and is undergoing addition of functionalities.
## The method 2 and method 3 are yet to be completed.
